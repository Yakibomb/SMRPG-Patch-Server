Super Mario RPG Expansion
Author: al2fenrir
Patch: Super_Mario_RPG_Expansion_(v1.1).ips
Version: v1.1b
Date: October 10, 2009
Desc: - It is based on Waddler-D's True Remix hack. Thus, you can also expect it to have up to level 50. However, all the spell learn, character level up stats, and stat bonuses have been tweaked. The only system preserved is the Next level timing. (Note that I am not trying to compete with Waddler-D. As a matter of fact, Waddler gets the credit from this since this is based on his hack)
Desc: 
Desc: - The level up system is now character specific. Mario has been designed to be versatile, thus his stats can be expected to be good on all sides, but his real strength is in Power. Mallow is terrible in terms of physical defense, he compensates this weakness with his powerful spells (2nd to Geno), a very high HP, and a strong magic def. Geno is similar to the original SMRPG, he's still average in power. But he has been tweaked to be the most powerful spellcaster. His magic defense is second only to mallow though. Bowser, being the brute of the team is the strongest member there is.. he's only weakness is magic. Finally, Toadstool (Peach) is the weakest character in the game. She's the best support you can get as her healing spells comes really handy.
Desc: 
Desc: - The spells have also been rebalanced. Some of it now cost a lot, for instance, Peach's Come back now costs 14fp. It would be unfair to Smithy's gang if she can keep on resurrecting her buddies right? Well, not anymore! Jump and some spells have the tendency to miss also. This will really try your patience, most especially when you're trying to get the Super Suit (now Super Shirt).

Desc: (Patch Server Note: Softlocks after beating Nimbus Land, can't advance further)
