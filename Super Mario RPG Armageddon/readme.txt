Super Mario RPG: Armegeddon is a difficulty and content mod for Super Mario RPG. It rebalances the entire game and adds a lot more post-game content, such as more FF bosses, two boss rushes, and even some special guests!

This hack assumes you're VERY familiar with the original game. The game starts off relatively simple, but after Moleville the difficulty picks up. Looking for a difficult Mario RPG hack? This is it!

Patches should only be applied to the legally obtained 1999 US version of the ROM. Compatible with SNES9x 1.53+.
