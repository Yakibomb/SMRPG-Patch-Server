Parser for Patches on the Server
The parser identifies what text lines go where.
Any additional tags will make a new line.
Most useful for long descriptions, multiple Images and/or Categories
Write out the file as such:
-----------------------
    Title:        //  Name of the hack (Can also just have name of hack as the first line without "Title:" to parse)
    Author:       //  Author (parser also accepts "Authors:")
    Version:      //  Version Number
    Patch:        //  Patch file name
    Size:         //  File size of patch
    Date:         //  Release/Creation Date
    Description:  //  short description
    Features:     //  Technical features
    Image:        //  Preview image
    Website:      //  Site, website, forum thread, etc
    Category:     //  How LS categorizes this (LS creates new categories and can sort by category)
    Recommend:    //  Can write anything here, it'll tag the patch with a star and add a "Recommended" category
