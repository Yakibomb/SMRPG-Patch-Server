Super Mario RPG: Armegeddon is a difficulty and content mod for Super Mario RPG created by Darkkefka and Doomsday31415.  It rebalances and reimagines the entire game and adds a lot more content after Smithy, such as over a dozen new Final Fantasy bosses, countless Pokemon, several boss rushes, and even some special guests!

Special thanks to WolfBladeEJ89 for the awesome box art!


Starting with v8, each version comes with an easier and a harder difficulty.
 - If you're new to SMRPG or just want to see all the new content, choose the easier difficulty!
 - If you're a veteran looking for the full Armageddon experience, suffer through hard mode!

If you try to switch between versions in the middle, you will only encounter sadness and misery.

WARNING: v10 Hard gets even more difficult than previous hard modes.  It is highly recomended to play Normal mode first.  You have been warned!


You can apply the patch with a tool such as Lunar IPS.
Patches should only be applied to a legally obtained 1999 US version of the ROM.

Compatible with Snes9X 1.53+.
Do NOT use ZSNES, as using that emulator is too old and broken and will only result in the game eventually crashing.
