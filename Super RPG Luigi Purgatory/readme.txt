SUPER RPG: LUIGI PURGATORY

I've been working on it technically since May 2016. Either way, it's finally here.

SYNOPSIS 

Luigi has been cursed by the demons of spirit and has been sent to purgatory to relive his brother's past life due to his sins. Luigi travels through a gloomy, grey version of his brother's world. He meets up with his girlfriend Daisy, King Bowser and finds two new companions by the name of Prince and Raino.

CHANGES BETWEEN THE ORIGINAL GAME (May contain spoilers)

Luigi Purgatory adds some new challenges into the game but here are some examples.
'Most (but not all) monsters have their stats boosted by 5%.
'Bosses have additional HP. (Hammer Bro has 75 Hp for example.)
'Some monsters have changed battlescripts and/or have different movesets. 
'Some new monsters have been added.
'Some NPC's have changed animations, making timed hits harder.
'All monsters have an intro animation before fighting.
'The text has been mildly altered to replace "Mario" with "Luigi", and "Toadstool" with "Daisy". Some dialogue has also been changed to remove text overflow.
'Items have been changed to reflect newer Mario RPGs. (The Pick Me Up item is now a 1-Up Mushroom)
'Some formations have changed music.
'Most of the songs have been remixed and are as catchy as ever.
'Enemy names and sprites are changed.
'The intro has been modified to reflect the characters and story.


Let me know if you find any bugs. (I recommend Zsnes over Snes9x. Snes9x has some problems handling sprites and audio with the ROM.)
(The one I use is Zsnes 1.5 (Dec 22, 2006) to emulate this ROM.)


Version 1.01 update!

Adds a new title screen menu and updated fonts and inventory.
Fixed enemy locations. 
Slightly updated graphics.
Some new Psychopath thoughts.


I'll be sure to add and update more in the future.
