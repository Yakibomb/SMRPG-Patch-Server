Desc: A program that shuffles around a bunch of stuff in Super Mario RPG! The world looks the same, the game's objective is the same, but plenty of things can get shuffled around â€” such as playable characters, monsters, progression items, shop items, character/equipment/monster stats, and even Star Pieces! It's a different experience every time!
