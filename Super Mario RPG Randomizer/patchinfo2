Desc: A program that shuffles around a bunch of stuff in Super Mario RPG! The world looks the same, the game's objective is the same, but plenty of things can get shuffled around â€” such as playable characters, monsters, progression items, shop items, character/equipment/monster stats, and even Star Pieces! It's a different experience every time!

Desc: This new version is an open world randomizer, inspired by other works such as the FF4: Free Enterprise randomizer. This means most of the map is open from the start which drastically changes the gameplay!
