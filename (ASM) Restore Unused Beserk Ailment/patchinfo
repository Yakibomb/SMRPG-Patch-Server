Author: Yaki
Date: February 17, 2025
Patch: (ASM) Berserk Patch v1.ips
Tag: Assembly Hack
Description: The Berserk status is an unused ailment in Super Mario RPG.
Desc: What is does, by default, is forces the one afflicted with the ailment to use a physical attack on a random target, without disgression of being a friend, themselves, or foe.
Desc: This patch fixes being able to apply the ailment on allies, and provides an aestheic fix in the ASM (makes the character's head bob up and down).
Desc: Allies still need a battle portrait animation sequence, which this patch does not apply. The sequence is "06" in the editor.
Desc: 
Desc: It works only on allies (for now). If applied to a monster, the monster always misses (this is a bug from the original game).
Desc: 
Desc: This does /not/ change anything outside of the ASM, so it is safe to apply to any ROM file.
Desc: ASM is in the readme.
