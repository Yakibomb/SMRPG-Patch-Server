Patch: (ASM) Berserk Patch v1.ips
Tag: Assembly Hack
Description: The Berserk status is an unused ailment in Super Mario RPG.
Desc: What is does, by default, is forces the one afflicted with the ailment to use a physical attack on a random target, without disgression of being a friend, themselves, or foe.
Desc: This patch fixes being able to apply the ailment on allies, and provides a few aesthetic fixes in the ASM.
Desc: 
Desc: It works only on allies (for now). If applied to a monster, the monster always misses.
Desc: 
Desc: This does /not/ change anything outside of the ASM, so it is safe to apply to any ROM file.
Desc: If, for any reason, you want to apply the code in the patch manually, the ASM is at the bottom of this document.
