Plumber's Parasitic Plant Problem (Demo 1) 
Author: Yakibomb 
Description from the Author: 
"Here is a hack I've been working on for several months now. This demo was created for NCFC, or the Nintendo Fan Games Convention in August of 2015. The narrator, Toad, explains some of the backstory behind the events that will take place in the hack. It plays up until the first boss, after which the player is told they cannot proceed further. 
I hope you enjoy! Please comment in the thread on SMWC, I always appreciate any drops of a line anywhere on the forum!" 

Story
There is a land where Toads and piranha plants live side by side peacefully. This island is called "Peaceful Piranha Plant Paradise", and this is where our story takes place...

The legendary plumber, the royal princess and the great and awesome Toad go on vacation to this island, but the blissful adventure turns to a one of duty and obligation as heroes. The once docile piranha plants of the island are suddenly becoming malicious, and are populating in unexpected places. Mario and others must get the assistance of local plumber experts, as well as a local scientist, to find the source of the piranha plant uproar and to bring the once peaceful paradise back to a hip vacation spot. Who or what could be behind the sudden outburst of the island's piranha plant population?
