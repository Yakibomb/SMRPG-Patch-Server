Because the original game is really easy, you can make it harder by doing low level runs, that's why I created this hack. 

Now it is easier to do low level runs because the enemies now give 0 exp, excepting Goombas that give only one point of experience (to level up if it's too hard). 
Thanks to this, you don't have to use the Lucky Hammer/Jewel, saving a lot of time. 


These are the changes so far: 

- Goombas are the only enemies who give experience (1 point). 
- Removed Lucky! Flower bonus of some enemies. 
- All treasure chests that gave the Star Power in vanilla, were changed to give Frog Coins/Flowers instead. 
- When selecting between saves, the Mario sprites were changed with 8-bit Mario sprites. 
- Fixed a typo: "Recoer" in the description of Mushroom in the Baby Goomba shop in Monstro Town. 

Glitch: 

- If you move the cursor after saving, you can see a strange coloured Mario.

Also, there will be a harder version, so stay tuned.
