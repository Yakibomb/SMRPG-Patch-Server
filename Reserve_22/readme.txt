Approx. hack length: 30 minutes.

Detailed information. Nothing extravagant here, just a small ROM hack. Mario finds himself falling from the sky into a mansion owned by some Lakitu named “Laki-Laki.” whom has let her mansion be infested with ghosts and ghouls of several kinds.

Creepy stuff happens in nowhere.

See for yourself what happens.

You’re welcome to pick apart this hack, and learn from what it has to offer, despite not being a whole lot. This hack was lots of trial and error, and I wanted to make Gian a little more hopeful that people CAN make some cool stuff with his editor, since there aren’t as many hacks as in Super Mario World.

You can’t just pick up the editor and make some stupid, glitchy level and call it a hack. …well, no, that’s not true. You can do it, it just takes more effort to create something in LS than LM.

Point is, I want feedback on this hack, and hope that some people can use some tricks that I used here to create your own hacks, or improve on them.
