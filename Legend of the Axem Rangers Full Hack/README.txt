Super Mario RPG - Legend of the Axem Rangers - Version 2.0
By AnAxemRanger A.K.A. Partsunknown109
==========================================================
This is version 2.0 of the hack.
Version 1.0 was just a simple graphical change which changed the 5 original characters into the Axem Rangers, and
nothing else.  Version 2.0 is VERY different.  It is an ENTIRELY new hack that chanes EVERYTHING.

Story
=====
Red, the main character, comes home one day to find that his sister, Pink, is missing.  Realizing
that Pink is not the kind of person to leave without at least leaving a note, Red suspects the
worst.  Having no leads whatsoever, Red decides to pay a visit to a certain castle where a 
certain Koopa King lives; a Koopa King that everyone knows has a thing for kidnapping ladies in
pink.

Questions
=========

Q: What is this?
A: This is a hack (well, mod really) of Super Mario RPG.  When you apply this IPS patch to a
	fresh Super Mario RPG ROM, your game will be changed into Super Mario RPG, Legend of the
	Axem Rangers.

Q: How do you apply this patch?
A: Google it.  If you really can't figure it out after that, ask me again.

Q: Is there any particular version of an Super Mario RPG ROM I should use?
A: Probably.  Unfortunately, I didn't take any notes on which version I've been using, so I don't
	know what that version is.  Short answer: If your game looks horribly glitched after
	applying this patch, use a different version.

Q: So what makes this game different?
A: Everything. Most noticeably, the five original characters have been changed into the Axem
	Rangers.  You'll also find new levels, new enemies, new items, new events, new story, new everything.
	Although the game starts out a bit meh in terms of story, it picks up a bit later.  I promise :)
	I first started this game when I was just getting to learn the ins and outs of editing this game, so
	naturally, things in the beginning seem more unpolished than things towards the end.

Q: Anything I should know about this game?
A: Yes.  Unfortunately, during my adventures hacking this game, my ROM has experienced some corruption and
	glitching that makes this virtually impossible to edit with the editing program I was using.  In other
	words, there's more that I wanted to do with this hack that I simply cannot do anymore.  But it's still
	fun to play, don't you worry about that! :)  In addition to not being able to add new stuff, it also
	makes it difficult to fix problems that the game might have.  But fear not, the game should still be very
	much playable.  But I would save whenever you can, and keep emergency save states (if your emulator has
	them) just in case you accidentally find yourself in some inescapble error of some kind.  But I've played
	through this game myself several times to test different stuff, and I didn't really find any of those
	kinds of errors.  Still, it helps to be prepared.

Also, here is a list of important thinks to be aware of as you progress through the game.
	-When you're in Booster University, DO NOT sell the items you pick up from the Snifits.
	You MUST have them in order to progress.  
	-Black's unarmed attack and his "Double punch"attack lead to graphical errors.  I'm working on this.  
	-A few NPCs look messed up graphically.  
	-sometimes when you jump, you'll see a weird shadow or something.  I'm working on these as well.  
	-There is also a known error in the Rose Town shop: if you get the secret chest in that room and 			then come back into that room through the chimney,
	the game will glitch up and you'll have to reset it.  I'm still working on this but for
	now, don't go in through the chimney after you get the secret chest (it should work fine
	before you get the hidden chest, however).
	-There is also an odd error with some secret chests: After obtaining them, some empty
	hidden chests will disappear and never reappear upon re-entering a room.  I don't know
	why this happens, but it's not a priority for me right now because you can still open
	the chest and get what's inside before they disappear entirely.
	-There are a couple of locked doors in Nimbus Castle that will appear to be open, but you won't be 			able to go through them.
	As long as you have both keys, just press "A" on the open door and you should be able to hear
	an unlocking sound and then the barrier will be removed.
	-Some trampolines won't take you where you want to go the first time you jump on them.  For example, they
	might just hop you off next to it rather than taking you sky high into the next area.  If this happens,
	just try jumping on it a second time and it should work.
	-There is a glitch with the "Quake Hammer" weapon.  Sometimes the hammer will remain after the attack is
	over and it will just kind of flaot there and eventually cause some minor graphical glitches.  It's
	odd, this glitch only seems to happen sometimes.  I don't know what causes it or how to fix it.  To get
	technical, the event script that controls this weapon does in fact have a "remove object" command at the
	end of it, but sometimes it just doesn't work.  I have no idea why.  Sorry :(

Q: What's the difficulty like?
A: It's not too hard, but it's certainly harder than the original Super Mario RPG.  It can be especially
	punishing towards the start of the game.  But, I also give you a ton of money to use towards the 		beginning, as well as early access to a shop.  Spend it wisely, but buy a lot.
	As long as you play through the game with a reasonable amount
	of items, and fighting a reasonable amount of enemies to get coins and experience, you should be able to
	get through this without too much difficulty.  Also, you shouldn't feel forced to level up certain
	charactes in certain ways.  For example, you shouldn't always have to choose the magic based level up
	bonus every time Green (a more magic based character) levels up.  You can generally give the characters
	any bonus of your choosing and still do reasonably well.

Q: I like what you did with (Insert thing you liked here).  Do you mind if use it for my own
	hack or something else?
A: By all means, use whatever you want.  Credit would be nice though.  If you try to post this
	hack somewhere and claim its yours, I will be mad.  I will find you... and I will kill
	you.  Seriously though, you can use whatever you want as long as I get some credit.

If you have any questions or comments or problems, try posting them in this thread on Board 2:

This is where the most up to date info about this mod can be found.  If that doesn't work, you can try
emailing me at anaxemranger@gmail.com.
Seriously though, posting in the above thread is more likely to get you a response since I don't check my
email that often.  If you have a complaint about some glitch or error or something, please let me know.  However,
because of weird glitches and corruption within the game, there are some things I simply might not be able to
fix.  Sorry :(
