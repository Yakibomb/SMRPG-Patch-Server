Super Mario RPG Revolution 5.0 
Author: Waddler-D 
Description: Waddler-D has worked very hard to completely overhaul the combat portion of the game to include many unique and diverse battles. This hack requires much more battle strategy than the original, but not so much that it isn't fun. (This doesn't compare to the level of difficulty in SMRPG: Armageddon) 
Features: All enemy battle scripts changed, party member level cap is set to 50, many new items (with helpful descriptions!), and more.
