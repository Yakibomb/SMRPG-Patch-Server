Description: Bowser’s last deal with the so-called Bob-omb Mafia has left him empty-handed: the four koopa shells that belong to him still remain in the mafia’s hands. Bowser has kidnapped the princess and is holding her for a ransom–it’s Mario’s task to fulfill the mafia’s end of the bargain and acquire Bowser’s shells to rescue the princess.
