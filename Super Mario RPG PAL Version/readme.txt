Super Mario RPG was never released in Europe until it's virtual console release.

While I have no problem with it, I wanted to see what it would've been like if it did back in 1996.

With the LazyShell editor Super Mario RPG: The PAL Edition was created.

Version 1.0 18th Feburary

How to install: Use a file patcher like IPSwin to patch the file to the US Rom of Super Mario RPG
and it will work fine.

Changes Made;

-Toadstool renamed to Peach
-Bowser's Keep renamed Bowser's Castle
-Mushroom Kingdom renamed Toad Town
-Magikoopa renamed to Kamek
-Goby renamed to Cheep-Cheep
-The Big Boo renamed to Boo
-War Fan renamed to Folding Fan
-NokNok Shell renamed Koopa Shell
-Nautica Dress renamed Sailor Dress
-Dialogue changes but nothing really major
-Two new items created but can only be bought by Toad at the end of the game
-Command icons changed to match PAL SNES controller, same as well in the Bowyer boss fight
