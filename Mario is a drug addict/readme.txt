Mario has done it this time! His drug abuse has led to the apocalypse and the only way to save the world is to get sober. Use your super jacked up powers to fight super boosted enemies in this HILARIOUS upgrade of an already HILARIOUS game.

It took months to make and now I am confident all the bugs are fixed. If you have any comments, ideas, or bugs to tell me about please send to raccoonwarlord@gmail.com
