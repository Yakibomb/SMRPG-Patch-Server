Super Mario RPG Revolution - A ROM Hack by Waddler-D.

Progress Report
---------------
V5.0 - ABSOLUTE Release.  Fixes ALL bugs that existed in previous versions, including the bugs where the battle message doesn't pop up for specials after Level 30.  They will NEVER pop up now.  Fixed the Lamb's Lure not working properly and not allowing you to obtain a certain later item.  Thunderbolt (Mg. Power 32 vs. 24), Geno Beam (Mg. Power 48 vs. 40) and Geno Flash/Geno Flare (Mg. Power 90 vs. 85) have seen a significant Mg. Power increase.  Spire and Sleepy Time has seen Mg. power decreases but are ALSO the only other specials blessed with the Jump Counter bump still.  Geno Whirl now costs 8 FP and Terrorize now does damage again.  All enemies, bosses, characters, weapons equipment, jump counters (Yes, the one that's attached to Jump), timing, items, specials, and level ups are now completely balanced.  Save Point in Bowser's Castle moved back out of Croco's Room and placed before Kamek to fix a glitchy bug that occurs in the Factory section of the Gate area.  All messages have been proofread and edited.  "Bob" the Shy Ranger now has a more appropriate name.  Slight dialogue change, talk to the guy behind the house to the left of the castle in Mushroom Kingdom at the beginning!  Triplets' Shop sells more useful selection of items and also sells a very much improved "Mushroom".  Bad Mushroom can mute OR Poison enemies.  A few bosses have been tweaked and/or improved to be more balanced and/or difficult.  Culex will still kill you at any Level if you're not careful.  ALL FUTURE RELEASES WILL BE FOR THE SAKE OF BUG FIXING!

v4.1 - Penultimate FINAL Release.  Applies some fixes to a few specials, balancing them out.  Also applied a few minor fixes as well.  Not completely finished.

V4.0 - FINAL Release.  Nearly Complete overhaul of the hack. Names of enemies, attacks and spells edited to be more fitting to the Japanese version of the game and to make more sense out of the attack.  The pricing of Sleepy Bomb is fixed.  Mallow given Thunderbolt as his first special and all enemies and bosses are balanced as best as possible.  Some enemies and bosses have seen improvements to their scripts to make sure that the game is fair but giving off a challenging vibe.  New equipment and items have been made, while some items have been changed to be made more useful.  Most other equipment has been tweaked to maintain that balance.  EXP and monetary gains have been tweaked to be generally more rewarding but to establish a flow with the game.  Characters and characters' stats have been tweaked to bring a greater balance between the party members.  Bosses have all been tested to ensure that no bugs or oddities exist any more.  The bug with the Specials menu where characters would learn a special at Level 51 has been fixed.  Smithy, Jinx, and Culex have been tweaked. Some enemy spells have been made weaker for balancing issues.  Save point before Kamek/Magikoopa has been moved into the room with Croco's 2nd shop to prevent problems of possibly "getting stuck" due to Kamek/Magikoopa's increased difficulty.  Two of the three Musty Fears' flags have been moved.

V3.0 - Pending FINAL release.  Fixed the bugs with Shy Rangers, Axem Rangers and Helios.  Fixed a few goofy battle formations.  Bugs with Defender, Exor that were found were also fixed.  Battle Scripts have been looked over and improved if needed.  Enemies and bosses received one last thorough balancing, so that the difficulty curve is better maintained.  Bowser's Terrorize special no longer does damage.  Peach's Sleepy Time special now does damage (Mg. Power of 50).  Peach's Mute Special now will never miss.  Timing for Geno Whirl has been lowered from 8 frames to 5 now.  Prices at the Frog Disciple's Shop has been lowered.  Various accessories and equipment improved.  Fixed a mistake with Yoshi Candy.  Fixed Falcon Helm and Red Cap not protecting characters from certains status effects.  Increased EXP gain for Machine Made enemies and some of the enemies in Forest Maze (for easier leveling up).

V2.0 - Fixed most of the bugs and glitches of all the bosses, enemies, and battle formations with testing involved.  Buffed Falcon Helm and Red Cap even more (status protection), A few bosses has been changed from before: a few are less annoying, but more are harder.  Geno Boost only boosts Attack and Magic Defense now, but still has 2 frames for Defense.  Only few minor bugs remains, but the hack is officially complete!

V1.30 & V1.31 - Fixed a few problems with Culex (NOT MAJOR), and a horrible Level-up bug (Broken Peach, and broken stats).  Also, Geno Boost & Ultra Jump has been balanced even more, but frame for timing is increased for Geno Boost slightly.  Also, minor changes & fixes to some bosses.

V1.20 & V1.21 - Fixes major battle bugs with Croco #2, Machine Made Yaridovich, Replacement Boss, and Culex. Also, Smithy, Jinx and Culex have been severely revamped and star grinding is less broken. Mallow and Geno have been buffed and a few of their specials improved. Stats and prices of certain pieces of equipment and items improved. Version 1.20 has V1.1a's characters specials table while Version 1.21 has the new specials table. Example: Bowser learns Bowser Crush at Level 37 in V1.20, he will learn the same special at Level 30 in V1.21.

V1.1a - Fixed a bug with Yoshi-Ade (It's so broken, it apparently freezes the game), it now is fixed but with reduced chances of getting a freebie and only boosts Attack and Defense.  Tweaked Smithy's Body Attack Power to present more of a challenge.

V1.1 - Improved a few enemies' scripts and made a quick glance for bugs with all enemies and bosses.  All future updates will most likely be for aesthetic or clean-up reasons.

V1.0b (Short-lived) - Fixes annoying script hiccups with Croco (Moleville Mines), Grate Guy and Dodo (the optional variant).

V1.0a - Fixed Bowser's Castle #1 monster formation packs.  Apparently, a late game boss would pretty much prevent anybody from progressing.  The problem was figured out and solved.

V1.0 - Initial Release

NOTE: This hack is in essence a BALANCED difficulty hack and asks for the player to know how to time well and to use their head against gimmicky enemies and bosses.  While grinding is possible, it is balanced and can be time-consuming, but going through the bosses at the recommended levels below will give you an idea of where you need to be at which point.  However, Culex is another story entirely...

This is a ROM hack of Super Mario RPG that shows off what you can do with the statistical, gameplay (battle system-wise) aspects of this masterpiece constructed by the combined efforts of Nintendo and Squaresoft (now Square Enix) mostly, but also shows what you can do in terms of attack animations and other things.

How to install the hack and what you will need:
- A SMRPG ROM (Two .ips patches included for headered and headerless ROMs)
- The .ips patch
- An emulator to play the patched ROM with (Preferably SNES9x 1.42, 1.51 or 1.52.  You can also use ZSNES 1.42 or V1.50 but the emulator is not optimal for Super Mario RPG, don't use ZSNES 1.51 or else you'll get that freezing bug).

The "SMRPGRevolutionV5.0.ips" patch is for SMRPG ROMs that have no header (They're 4,096 KB as a result) while the "SMRPGRevolutionV5.0Headered.ips" patch is for SMRPG ROMs that have a header (They're 4,097 KB).  Those that have a SMRPG ROM that's patched with V4.1 should use the "SMRPGRevolutionV4.1V5.0.ips" patch if they would like to continue their progress.  However, this is not recommended due to save compatibility issues.

NOTE: For those that have progressed into V4.1, I WILL release a V4.1 to V5.0 patch.  However, save compatibility is definitely not a guarantee here.  There are much more changes with V5.0 that were not present with V4.0/V4.1 and could experience some considerable problems.  I'd RECOMMEND starting over but you certainly don't have to if you don't want to at all.  I'd highly advise NOT updating to V5.0 if you want to continue off a save in V4.1 that's beyond the fight with Magikoopa in Bowser's Castle the second time through.

Known Bugs

1. Therapy and Group Hug apparently nullify Red Essence Effects for some unknown reason.  The properities of the two specials are entirely the same as they were in the original, except for FP cost and Magic Power.  It may have been a bug in the original as well...

2. If Octovader kills himself with his own spell and is the only enemy alive, the battle lingers a bit longer, but will end shortly.  Also the same goes for enemies using Psyche or Migraine, there is a slight delay.

Unknown Bugs

-Please report any bugs that you experience throughout the course of play and I try my best to get them fixed!-
