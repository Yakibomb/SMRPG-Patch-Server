Version: v2.0
Patch: SMRPGRevolutionV2.0.ips
Size: 59.4 KB
Desc: V2.0 - Fixed most of the bugs and glitches of all the bosses, enemies, and battle formations with testing involved.  Buffed Falcon Helm and Red Cap even more (status protection), A few bosses has been changed from before: a few are less annoying, but more are harder.  Geno Boost only boosts Attack and Magic Defense now, but still has 2 frames for Defense.  Only few minor bugs remains, but the hack is officially complete!
