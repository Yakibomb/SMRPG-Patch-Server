Desc: V4.0 - FINAL Release.  Nearly Complete overhaul of the hack. Names of enemies, attacks and spells edited to be more fitting to the Japanese version of the game and to make more sense out of the attack.  The pricing of Sleepy Bomb is fixed.  Mallow given Thunderbolt as his first special and all enemies and bosses are balanced as best as possible.  Some enemies and bosses have seen improvements to their scripts to make sure that the game is fair but giving off a challenging vibe.  New equipment and items have been made, while some items have been changed to be made more useful.  Most other equipment has been tweaked to maintain that balance.  EXP and monetary gains have been tweaked to be generally more rewarding but to establish a flow with the game.  Characters and characters' stats have been tweaked to bring a greater balance between the party members.  Bosses have all been tested to ensure that no bugs or oddities exist any more.  The bug with the Specials menu where characters would learn a special at Level 51 has been fixed.  Smithy, Jinx, and Culex have been tweaked. Some enemy spells have been made weaker for balancing issues.  Save point before Kamek/Magikoopa has been moved into the room with Croco's 2nd shop to prevent problems of possibly "getting stuck" due to Kamek/Magikoopa's increased difficulty.  Two of the three Musty Fears' flags have been moved.
