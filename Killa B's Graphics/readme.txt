==========================  SMRPG Hack by Killa B  ============================
==========================   November 30th, 2007   ============================

    Thank you so much for actually reading this! I freaking hate it when people
  don't read the documentation before using stuff. What made you decide to look
  at it? Was it the large capital letters?

             You can get the latest version of this patch from:
                        http://killa-b.freehostia.com
             (Although this will probably be the only release ;D)

=====  I. Instructions  =======================================================

    First you're going to need a copy of the Super Mario RPG (U) rom. I dunno
  where to get it lol ¯\_(°.o)_/¯ Then, once you have the rom you're going to
  need an IPS Patching program. I use Lunar IPS. If you have a headered rom,
  use the "[Killa B] SMRPG Hack Headered.ips" file. If your rom is unheadered,
  you should use the "[Killa B] SMRPG Hack Unheadered.ips" file. If you have no
  idea if your rom is headered or not, it's probably headered. Then use Lunar
  IPS (or whatever you're using) and apply the patch to the clean rom. You
  might want to make a copy of the rom first, though.


=====  II. Information  =======================================================

    I was originally working on this hack pretty intently. I was really proud
  of my work, too. I (unintentionally) spammed the hell out of the Screenshots
  thread on RHDN with my own screenshots. Seriously, not to sound conceited or
  anything, but I think I might be solely responsible for the Personal Projects
  board. I don't know if that's something I should be proud of, though. I think
  the mods were pretty pissed at me at that time.
  
    So, anyway, I was working really hard on the hack. Then all of a sudden I
  realized that I didn't have any plans for it. I had no idea what I wanted to
  do. I was pretty much just screwing around the entire time. But, whatever. I
  decided to release this patch, just for the hell of it. Plus I don't want
  anyone to think my SMRPG screenshots were bullshit. :D
  
    The patch changes the battle menu. It also changes the buttons in the
  Bowyer fight.


=====  III. Copyright Info  ===================================================

    Okay, uh... Mario and related characters belong to Nintendo. Super Mario
  RPG belongs to Square Enix (I think.)

    I don't claim to copyright this hack, but I'll still be pissed if someone
  tries to pass it off as their own. So please don't.
  
    And special thanks to Dragonsbrethren for helping me out with the Bowyer
  button design. Although he probably doesn't even remember.


=====  IV. SECRET BONUS SECTION  ==============================================

    God, what the hell am I putting this section in here for? I think I'm
  retarded. Uh... Yaridovich is awesome. And the answer to the Sunken Ship
  puzzle is 'PEARLS', god dammit.
  
    Oh, and Culex is not from any Final Fantasy game. Just trust me on this
  one. If you still think otherwise, please promptly kill yourself.
  
    ...This readme is bigger than the actual patch. Heh.
